# Matlab-Interpolation-and-Dc-Equalization---Image-processing
Based on the algorithm shown in Figure 2, it is necessary to realise the steps shown. After the first step (ECG Acquisition System / ECG from Standard Database) 
and second step (Peak Detection and Segmentation based on R Peak) an ECG signal with detected R peaks with QRS complex is obtained and based on them the file *.txt is generated. 
Based on the *.txt file, it is necessary to do Interpolation and Dc Equalization in order to get Figure 4. 
Is there a matlab plugin (toolbox) that implements Interpolation and Dc Equalization?  Attached is the document in which the given procedure was applied.
